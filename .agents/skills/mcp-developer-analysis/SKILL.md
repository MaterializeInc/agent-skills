# Materialize Developer Analysis

Analyze a Materialize environment via the MCP Developer endpoint and produce a
structured report with health status, performance findings, and optimization
recommendations. Assumes Materialize v26.24 or later.

The developer endpoint exposes two read-only tools:

- **`query_system_catalog`** — `SELECT`/`SHOW`/`EXPLAIN` restricted to system
  catalog tables (`mz_*`, `pg_catalog`, `information_schema`). Takes no cluster
  argument, and one passed anyway is silently ignored rather than rejected.
  Catalog reads are auto-routed to the catalog server cluster
  (`mz_catalog_server`) while `auto_route_catalog_queries` is on (the
  default); anything the router cannot serve there — notably every
  `mz_introspection` relation — runs on the session's default cluster (the
  role's `cluster` default if set, else the system default, `quickstart`
  unless the operator changed it). Use for most catalog lookups.
- **`query`** (added in Materialize v26.30) — `SELECT`/`SHOW`/`EXPLAIN` against
  any object the role can access, on the cluster named by its required
  `cluster` argument (plus, from v26.33, an optional `cluster_replica`).
  Required for `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (it must run on the
  MV/index's cluster) and for reading user data directly. May be hidden when
  the operator has disabled `enable_mcp_developer_query_tool`.

## Connecting an MCP client to `materialize-developer`

If the user is asking how to **configure**, **connect**, or **set up** an MCP
client (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Zed, Continue, Windsurf, Claude Desktop)
to talk to the `materialize-developer` server — including how to control which
user or role the connection uses, or how to switch between identities — see
[`mcp-client-connect.md`](mcp-client-connect.md). It covers the Emulator,
Materialize Cloud, and self-managed deployments, with per-client snippets,
authentication patterns, and verification recipes.

The rest of this `SKILL.md` covers what to do *once you are connected* and want
to analyze the environment.

## Discovering Tables and Columns

**Do NOT guess column names.** System catalog relations are a mix of tables,
views, materialized views and sources, so no single `SHOW TABLES` or
`SHOW VIEWS` lists them all; use `SHOW OBJECTS FROM <schema>`. The ontology
views in `mz_internal` describe the catalog; use them to discover the correct
tables, columns, join paths, and ID types:

| Table | What it tells you |
|-------|-------------------|
| `mz_internal.mz_ontology_entity_types` | What catalog entities exist and which `mz_*` table they map to. |
| `mz_internal.mz_ontology_link_types` | Relationships between entities (foreign keys, metrics, etc.). |
| `mz_internal.mz_ontology_properties` | Column names, types, and descriptions for each entity. |
| `mz_internal.mz_ontology_semantic_types` | Typed ID domains (CatalogItemId, ReplicaId, etc.). |

Example queries:
```sql
-- Find the right table for an entity
SELECT name, relation, description
FROM mz_internal.mz_ontology_entity_types
WHERE name LIKE '%source%'

-- Find join paths between entities
SELECT name, source_entity, target_entity, properties, description
FROM mz_internal.mz_ontology_link_types
WHERE source_entity = 'source' OR target_entity = 'source'

-- Find columns for a table
SELECT column_name, semantic_type, description
FROM mz_internal.mz_ontology_properties
WHERE entity_type = 'source_status'
```

Verify column names with `SHOW COLUMNS FROM <schema>.<table>` before querying.

## Critical Rules

The server's own `initialize` instructions carry the catalog gotchas: column
names such as `last_status_change_at`, the replica-to-cluster JOIN for
`mz_cluster_replica_utilization`, the ontology views, and from v26.40 the
`mz_introspection` routing and id types. Most clients forward them; if yours
does not, `SHOW COLUMNS` is the fallback.

### `mz_introspection` relations need the `query` tool

Every `mz_introspection` relation, `mz_dataflow_arrangement_sizes` included,
is cluster-scoped, and `query_system_catalog` cannot target a cluster, so
through that tool the read lands on the session's default cluster: with
exactly one replica there you get its numbers, or an empty result, with no
error; with several replicas the read fails with `log source reads must
target a replica`, with none with `has no replicas available to service
request`. Read them through `query` with the `cluster` argument, plus
`cluster_replica` (from v26.33) on a cluster with more than one replica
(unbilled ones count), which is what the first error asks for; nothing fixes
the second.
Servers before v26.40 say in their `initialize` instructions never
to query `mz_dataflow_arrangement_sizes`; that rule predates the `query`
tool, and this supersedes it. The query, its join path to the catalog, and
its caveats are under Arrangement Sizes in `references/queries.md`. Without
the `query` tool, fall back to the relations under Memory and Resource
Consumption below.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Connect** — Verify the MCP Developer tools are available
2. **Discover** — Use the ontology + catalog queries to inventory all deployed objects
3. **Analyze** — Assess performance metrics: freshness, hydration, memory, utilization
4. **Report** — Produce a structured markdown report with findings and recommendations

## Step 1: Verify MCP Connection

Confirm you have access to the `query_system_catalog` tool. Run a quick test:

```
query_system_catalog: SELECT mz_version() FROM mz_catalog.mz_databases LIMIT 1
```

`query_system_catalog` rejects a `SELECT` that references no system catalog
table, so a bare `SELECT mz_version()` fails with `Query must reference at
least one system catalog table`, which reads like a broken connection.

Check whether a `query` tool is among the tools your client exposes. With it
you can also run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and queries against user objects on a named
cluster; without it (operator disabled it, or a pre-v26.30 build), fall back
to `query_system_catalog` for everything that fits.

If `query_system_catalog` fails, check:
- The MCP server is registered in your client's MCP configuration (the
  file and key differ per client, see `mcp-client-connect.md`)
- The `enable_mcp_developer` feature flag is enabled on the environment
- Your authentication credentials are valid

### Running Queries

Both tools take one read-only statement per call, no `SET`, and no trailing
semicolon (one is tolerated; two statements are rejected).

Results come back as a bare array of rows with no column names, and every `AS`
alias is discarded, so map columns positionally and keep the `SELECT` list
short and in the order you intend to read it. Numbers arrive as strings,
booleans as JSON `true`/`false`, NULL as `null`; `timestamp` and `timestamptz`
values arrive as millisecond-since-epoch strings (`1787687415336.000`), so cast
them to `text` where you need a readable time. Qualify object names with the database when the object is not in the
session's database (`SHOW database`), or the statement fails with `unknown
schema`. A response is capped (1 MB by
default) and a request timed out (60 seconds by default), both configurable by
the operator and both surfacing as errors. A `LIMIT` keeps a catalog
enumeration under the cap, and shortens the work only for a plain read of one
indexed relation, not for a join. A timeout releases the call but sometimes
not the query, so do not retry a timed-out statement as it was.

`query_system_catalog` checks its allowlist by walking FROM-clause table
references, so statements without one are not checked at all: `SHOW TABLES`,
`SHOW COLUMNS`, the `SHOW CREATE` forms and object-level `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
pass there and can name user objects (which is why the latter answers empty,
see Worker Skew). Treat that as a fallback for when `query` is missing; use
`query` for user objects.

When filtering out system schemas, always exclude: `mz_catalog`, `mz_internal`,
`pg_catalog`, `information_schema`, and `mz_introspection`. `SHOW SCHEMAS` also
lists `mz_catalog_unstable` and `mz_unsafe`, which hold no relations.

## Step 2: Discover — Inventory the Environment

Run the discovery queries to understand what is deployed. See
`references/queries.md` for the full query set. The discovery phase covers:

### Environment Overview
- Materialize version
- Clusters and replicas — names, `managed`, replica counts and sizes. Start
  from `mz_clusters` and LEFT JOIN the replicas, or a cluster without
  replicas disappears from the inventory. An unmanaged cluster has NULL
  `size` and `replication_factor`; unbilled support replicas are listed in
  `mz_internal.mz_internal_cluster_replicas` and count like any other.
- Schemas in use

### Deployed Objects Inventory
- **Sources**: type (Kafka, Postgres, MySQL, Webhook, etc.), cluster
  assignment, status. `mz_sources` also has a row for every subsource and
  `progress` collection, so filter `type NOT IN ('subsource', 'progress')`
  before reporting a source count.
- **Materialized Views**: cluster assignment, indexes, dependencies
- **Views**: (non-materialized) and their usage patterns
- **Sinks**: type, destination, cluster assignment
- **Indexes**: what they're on, cluster assignment
- **Connections**: external system connections configured

### Object Definitions

Retrieve SQL definitions for materialized views, views, indexes, and sources
using `references/queries.md`. This is critical for optimization analysis —
the SQL definitions tell you *how* things are computed:
- Join patterns and join order
- Filter predicates (or lack thereof — missing temporal filters are a common issue)
- Aggregation strategies
- Whether MVs duplicate logic that could be shared

## Step 3: Analyze — Performance and Resource Metrics

### Freshness (Lag Analysis)
Query `mz_internal.mz_materialization_lag` for per-object lag. Its `local_lag`
and `global_lag` columns are plain `interval`s, so they compare and sort
directly, and `slowest_global_input_id` names the input holding the object
back. Both lags are measured against the inputs' frontiers, not the wall
clock: a pipeline whose source is paused shows zero lag while growing
arbitrarily stale, so also compare `mz_frontiers.write_frontier` with `now()`
(the Write Frontiers query).

`write_frontier` is not on this relation. It lives on
`mz_internal.mz_frontiers` as an `mz_timestamp`, which casts to `timestamptz`
for a readable time and to `text` (then `bigint`) for the raw number, never
directly to `bigint`. `references/queries.md` has the queries.

### Hydration Status
Query `mz_internal.mz_hydration_statuses` to check whether all dataflows are
hydrated. Non-hydrated objects after initial startup may indicate resource
pressure or configuration issues. LEFT JOIN the replica columns: `replica_id`
is NULL with no replica to hydrate on, and an inner join hides those objects.

### Memory and Resource Consumption
- `mz_internal.mz_cluster_replica_utilization` for memory/CPU percentage per replica process
- `mz_internal.mz_cluster_replica_metrics` for raw memory metrics, also one
  row per (replica, process)
- `mz_internal.mz_index_advice` to identify which MVs/indexes can be optimized

### Worker Skew (CPU imbalance across workers)

Use `WITH SKEW` to find operators where one worker does disproportionate
CPU/memory work.

**Run these through the `query` tool**, not `query_system_catalog`:
`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` executes on the cluster you pass as the `cluster` argument,
and for the object-level commands that must be the cluster the MV/index lives
on. Getting it wrong does not reliably error: on another single-replica
cluster, or through `query_system_catalog` when the default cluster has one
replica, the object-level commands return an empty result, which reads like
"no skew"; with several replicas the read fails with `log source reads must
target a replica`, with none with `has no replicas available to service
request`. Without `query`, this section is not actionable.

**Cluster-level (run on the cluster you want to inspect):**

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE CLUSTER CPU WITH SKEW
```

**Object-level (run for both the MV and its indexes):**

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE CPU WITH SKEW FOR MATERIALIZED VIEW <schema>.<mv_name>
```
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE CPU WITH SKEW FOR INDEX <schema>.<index_name>
```

If skew is present: identify the skewed operator (often TopK/window/agg/join/distinct), then inspect definitions (`SHOW CREATE ...`) and recommend a concrete SQL change (remove/adjust hints, refactor keys/partitioning, or rewrite the MV).

### Index Advice
Query `mz_internal.mz_index_advice`, Materialize's built-in advisor. It emits
exactly six hints: `keep`, `drop unless queried directly`, `convert to a view`,
`convert to a view with an index`, `convert to materialized view`, `add index`.
Filtering on a subset silently drops real recommendations;
`references/queries.md` says what each one means.

### Cost Analysis (optional)
Use the Cost Analysis queries in `references/queries.md` (per-replica pricing).

When writing recommendations, **always quantify the credit impact** (credits
are a Cloud billing unit; on self-managed the shipped sizes carry Cloud's
numbers and operator-defined sizes whatever the operator set, 0 by default,
so present them as relative weights at best).

### Object Dependencies
Query `mz_internal.mz_object_dependencies` to understand the dependency graph.

## Step 4: Report — Generate the Analysis

Produce a structured markdown report following
`references/report-template.md`: executive summary, cluster topology,
deployed objects, performance analysis (freshness, hydration, utilization,
worker skew, source and sink health), cost analysis, index advice, SQL-level
analysis, and numbered recommendations with specific SQL.

The Cluster Topology table comes from the `Cluster Topology` query in
`references/queries.md` plus the credit columns of `Current Compute Cost per
Cluster` there.

### Writing Recommendations

**Always include specific SQL commands.** For example:

Good:
> **Recommendation:** Dematerialize `my_schema.unused_mv` to save memory.
> ```sql
> SHOW CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW my_schema.unused_mv
> DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW my_schema.unused_mv
> CREATE VIEW my_schema.unused_mv AS <definition>
> ```

Bad:
> **Recommendation:** Consider dematerializing `my_schema.unused_mv`.

## Troubleshooting Runbooks

**Always end with specific SQL commands to fix the issue**, and never apply
one without the user's yes: scaling up or adding replicas costs money, and
dropping or altering objects loses state. Every fix below is DDL, which both
tools reject, so hand the commands to the user.

### "Why is my materialized view stale?"

**Diagnostic steps:**
1. Check whether the MV's cluster has any replica first: `mz_clusters` LEFT
   JOIN `mz_cluster_replicas` (the Clusters and Replicas query), not
   `replication_factor`, which is NULL on unmanaged clusters and blind to
   unbilled replicas. A cluster with no replicas runs nothing, and the steps
   below don't work well.
2. Check `mz_internal.mz_hydration_statuses` — is the MV hydrated, and is
   everything else on its cluster (the Non-Hydrated Objects query, restricted
   to that cluster)?
3. Check `mz_internal.mz_cluster_replica_status_history` for recent `offline`
   events with reason `oom-killed`, which covers the cgroup OOM killer, the
   heap limiter and a full lgalloc spill disk alike (the Replica Restarts
   query; the emulator records no reason, so there judge by the `offline`
   count): an OOM loop often reads `online` in the current status and modest
   in a utilization sample. Most OOMs happen during hydration, so the loop is
   over when step 2 shows everything hydrated and the latest history row per
   process is `online`; kills that recur after hydration completes are a
   steady-state loop, which only a size change or less on the cluster ends.
4. Check `mz_internal.mz_cluster_replica_utilization`: `memory_percent` near
   100 means RAM is full and further growth lands on swap where there is
   swap, felt as slow hydration or lag; `heap_percent` (RAM plus swap against
   the limit) climbing while `memory_percent` stays put is that swap in use,
   and near 100 the next spike kills the replica. Either way: scale up, move
   the MV, or shrink what the cluster holds (the fixes below, and step 7).
5. Check `mz_internal.mz_source_statuses` — upstream source errors?
6. Check `mz_internal.mz_materialization_lag` for the MV's lag (see Freshness)
7. If the `query` tool is available, run
   `EXPLAIN ANALYZE MEMORY FOR MATERIALIZED VIEW <schema>.<mv>` on the MV's
   cluster to see per-operator memory and spot expensive shapes (large
   arrangements, joins without indexes, missing temporal filters).

**Common fixes:**

*If the MV's cluster has no replicas:*
```sql
ALTER CLUSTER <cluster_name> SET (REPLICATION FACTOR 1)
```
```sql
-- Unmanaged cluster: add a replica directly
CREATE CLUSTER REPLICA <cluster_name>.r1 (SIZE = '<size>')
```

*If the cluster is overloaded (high memory/CPU):*
```sql
-- Option A: Scale up the cluster (unmanaged: DROP and CREATE its replicas
-- at the bigger size instead)
ALTER CLUSTER <cluster_name> SET (SIZE = '<next_size_up>')
```
```sql
-- Option B: Move the MV to a different cluster
SHOW CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW <schema>.<mv_name>
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW <schema>.<mv_name>
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW <schema>.<mv_name> IN CLUSTER <new_cluster> AS <definition>
```

*If an upstream source is not running:*
```sql
SELECT name, status, error, last_status_change_at
FROM mz_internal.mz_source_statuses
WHERE status != 'running'
```
Not every non-`running` status is a fault, and only `stalled` carries an
`error`; "Are my sources healthy?" below lists what each status means.
Fix the upstream source issue first. MV freshness depends on source health.

### "Why is my cluster running out of memory?"

**Diagnostic steps:**
1. Check `mz_internal.mz_cluster_replica_utilization` for memory percentage and
   `mz_cluster_replica_status_history` for `oom-killed` events (Replica Restarts)
2. Check `mz_internal.mz_index_advice` for MVs that can be dematerialized
3. Check MV definitions for missing temporal filters
4. Check for redundant indexes
5. If the `query` tool is available, run
   `EXPLAIN ANALYZE MEMORY FOR MATERIALIZED VIEW <schema>.<mv>` (or
   `FOR INDEX <name>`) on the suspect object's cluster to see which operators
   hold the most memory — the most direct way to confirm which arrangement is
   responsible.

**Common fixes:**

*Dematerialize MVs that don't need to be materialized:*
```sql
SELECT o.name, o.type, sc.name AS schema_name, ia.hint, ia.details
FROM mz_internal.mz_index_advice ia
JOIN mz_catalog.mz_objects o ON ia.object_id = o.id
JOIN mz_catalog.mz_schemas sc ON o.schema_id = sc.id
WHERE ia.hint = 'convert to a view'
```

`convert to a view with an index` and `convert to materialized view` are memory
recommendations too, with different remediations, so read the whole advice set
(the Index Advice query in `references/queries.md`) before acting on this one.

```sql
-- For each candidate:
SHOW CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW <schema>.<mv_name>
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW <schema>.<mv_name>
CREATE VIEW <schema>.<mv_name> AS <definition>
```

*Drop unused indexes:*
```sql
SELECT o.name, o.type, sc.name AS schema_name, ia.hint, ia.details
FROM mz_internal.mz_index_advice ia
JOIN mz_catalog.mz_objects o ON ia.object_id = o.id
JOIN mz_catalog.mz_schemas sc ON o.schema_id = sc.id
WHERE ia.hint = 'drop unless queried directly'
```

```sql
-- Verify with the user before dropping
DROP INDEX <schema>.<index_name>
```

*Scale up the cluster (unmanaged: DROP and CREATE its replicas at the bigger
size instead):*
```sql
ALTER CLUSTER <cluster_name> SET (SIZE = '<next_size_up>')
```

### "Are my sources healthy? / Has my source finished snapshotting?"

**Diagnostic steps:**
1. Check `mz_internal.mz_source_statuses` for source errors
2. Check `mz_internal.mz_source_statistics` for ingestion progress
3. Check `mz_internal.mz_materialization_lag` for end-to-end lag

**Common fixes:**

*If a source is not running:*
```sql
SELECT name, status, error
FROM mz_internal.mz_source_statuses
WHERE status != 'running'
```

The status is one of `created` (no status recorded yet), `starting`,
`running`, `paused`, `stalled` or `dropped`; the docs also list `failed`,
which the code never produces. Only `stalled` carries an `error`. Webhook and
`progress` rows always read `running`. `created` and `starting` are transient
and normal; `paused` means the source's cluster has no replicas, which no
amount of waiting fixes:

```sql
-- paused: give the source's cluster a replica
ALTER CLUSTER <cluster_name> SET (REPLICATION FACTOR 1)
-- unmanaged cluster: CREATE CLUSTER REPLICA <cluster_name>.r1 (SIZE = '<size>')
```
```sql
-- stalled/failed on bad credentials:
ALTER SECRET <secret_name> AS '<new_value>'
```

If `snapshot_committed` is `false`, the source is still loading its initial
snapshot. This is normal for large sources — wait for it to complete; it also
reads `false` with zero counters for about two minutes after a source or
replica starts. A source with no `mz_source_statistics` row at all never ran,
so check its status and whether its cluster has any replica instead of
waiting; a paused source keeps a stale row, so read `status` first.

### "What's the health of my environment?"

Run these checks in order:
1. `mz_internal.mz_cluster_replica_statuses` — all replicas of user clusters
   ready, and no recent `oom-killed` in `mz_cluster_replica_status_history`?
2. `mz_internal.mz_source_statuses` — all sources running?
3. `mz_internal.mz_sink_statuses` — all sinks running?
4. `mz_internal.mz_cluster_replica_utilization` — resource pressure?

### "What can I optimize to save costs?"

1. Check `mz_internal.mz_index_advice` for optimization candidates
2. Check cluster utilization — are clusters over-provisioned?
3. Check credit rates from `mz_catalog.mz_cluster_replica_sizes`

## Notes

- Access is governed by RBAC, so you only see the *data* your credentials have
  access to. The catalog is not gated the same way: a role with no object
  grants still reads the full object inventory, every view and MV `definition`,
  and all of `mz_index_advice`. Where RBAC is on, `query` and every read that
  is not auto-routed also need `USAGE` on the cluster they run on
  (`mz_catalog_server` grants it to `PUBLIC`). Whether RBAC checks are on
  depends on the deployment and its configuration; `SHOW enable_rbac_checks`
  and `SHOW enable_session_rbac_checks` tell (either `on` enables them).
- Freshness numbers are point-in-time snapshots. Re-run to check if lag is stable or growing.
